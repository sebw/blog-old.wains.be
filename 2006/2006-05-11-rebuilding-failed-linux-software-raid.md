This post will explain how I have rebuilt a software RAID array after a disk failure

I recently got a notification from the SMART daemon saying this : 


    
    <code>This email was generated by the smartd daemon running on:
    
      host name: gateway.domain.be
     DNS domain: domain.be
     NIS domain: (none)
    
    The following warning/error was logged by the smartd daemon:
    
    Device: /dev/hdd, 131 Currently unreadable (pending) sectors
    
    For details see host's SYSLOG (default: /var/log/messages).
    
    You can also use the smartctl utility for further investigation.
    No additional email messages about this problem will be sent.</code>



SMART values for the drives were these :

I removed the drive from the system, leading the RAID array to run degraded.

I got a new notification from the RAID system :


    
    <code>Subject : DegradedArray event on /dev/md0:gateway.domain.be
    
    This is an automatically generated mail message from mdadm
    running on gateway.domain.be
    
    A DegradedArray event had been detected on md device /dev/md0.
    
    Faithfully yours, etc.</code>



I did a low level format which fixed the pending sectors (not sure how long the drive will keep working though)..

**I was able to put the disk back in and rebuild the RAID array, follow the steps :**

When you look at a "normal" array, you see something like this:


    
    <code># cat /proc/mdstat
    Personalities : [raid1] 
    md0 : active raid1 hdc1[1] hdd1[0]
          58613056 blocks [2/2] [UU]
          
    unused devices: </code>



That's the normal state - what you want it to look like. When a drive has failed and been replaced, it looks like this:


    
    <code># cat /proc/mdstat
    Personalities : [raid1]
    md0 : active raid1 hdc1[1]
          58613056 blocks [2/1] [_U]
    unused devices: </code>



Notice that it doesn't list the failed drive parts, and that an underscore appears. This means that only one drive is active in these arrays - we have no mirror.

Another command that will show us the state of the raid drives is "mdadm"


    
    <code>[root @ SERVEUR](1074)# mdadm -D /dev/md0
    /dev/md0:
            Version : 00.90.01

             Events : 0.58886</code>



As this shows, we currently only have one drive working in the array.

Although I already knew that /dev/hdd was the other part of the raid array, you can look at /etc/raidtab to see how the raid was defined:


    
    <code>raiddev             /dev/md0
    raid-level                  1
    nr-raid-disks               2
    chunk-size                  64k
    persistent-superblock       1
    nr-spare-disks              0
        device          /dev/hdc1
        raid-disk     0
        device          /dev/hdd1
        raid-disk     1</code>



To get the mirrored drives working properly again, we need to run fdisk to see what partition we have on the working drive:


    
    <code>[root @ SERVEUR](1070)# fdisk /dev/hdc
    
    The number of cylinders for this disk is set to 7297.
    There is nothing wrong with that, but this is larger than 1024,
    and could in certain setups cause problems with:
    1) software that runs at boot time (e.g., old versions of LILO)
    2) booting and partitioning software from other OSs
       (e.g., DOS FDISK, OS/2 FDISK)
    
    Command (m for help): p
    
    Disk /dev/hdc: 60.0 GB, 60022480896 bytes
    255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 7297 cylinders
    Units = cylinders of 16065 * 512 = 8225280 bytes
    
       Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
    /dev/hdc1   *           1        7297    58613121   fd  Linux raid autodetect</code>



Duplicate that on /dev/hdd. 

"fdisk /dev/hdd", then use "n" to create the partitions, enter 1 and primary, then "t" to change their type to "fd" to match. 

Seems like there's an easier way to duplicate the partition tab (not tested !): 
`sfdisk -d /dev/hdc | sfdisk /dev/hdd`

Once this is done, use "raidhotadd":

`# raidhotadd /dev/md0 /dev/hdd1`

The rebuilding can be seen in /proc/mdstat:

`# cat /proc/mdstat
Personalities : [raid1] 
read_ahead 1024 sectors
md0 : active raid1 hdb1[0] hda1[1]
      58613056 blocks [2/1] [_U]
      [>....................]  recovery =  0.2% (250108/58613056 ) finish=28.8min speed=30032K/sec
unused devices: `
      
After it finishes, it will show:


    
    <code>[root @ SERVEUR](1074)# mdadm -D /dev/md0
    /dev/md0:
            Version : 00.90.01

You can restart the raid array (raidstart /dev/md0) and remount the drive if needed (eg : mount /dev/md0 /home)
