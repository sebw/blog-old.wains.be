# OpenLDAP, Evolution and Microsoft Outlook HOWTO

categories:
- Howto
- LDAP
- Linux


Matthew Feldt was kind enough to put up a guide explaining how to set up OpenLDAP as an addressbook compatible with Evolution and Microsoft Outlook.

Please visit his page here : [http://www.feldt.com/work/projects/openLDAP/](http://www.feldt.com/work/projects/openLDAP/)

A mirror of his page is available here : [http://blog.wains.be/mirrors/feldt.com/](http://blog.wains.be/mirrors/feldt.com/)

The guide works for CentOS/RHEL 4.4.

Thanks Matthew for that very well written howto !


For your information, LDAP support in Outlook is terrible. No autocompletion available.. pretty much like IMAP support.. "terrible on purpose" (tm)
