# The wonders of WinXP

My sound card stopped working for some unknown reason just in the middle of a session...

I tried repairing the drivers, then took the card out of the case and plugged it back in...

Windows XP found out a new device.. a network card.....

Then I came across this wizard...

Pressed ESC, it prompted me for a reboot...

Finally, the sound card is working again.. don't ask me about that new NIC,  I have no idea what it was...

Gotta love Windows XP
