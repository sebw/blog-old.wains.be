# Compiz Fusion keeps snapping windows to the edge of screen and other windows

categories:
- Linux


Even though the "snapping windows" plugin is disabled, the windows keep sticking to the edge of anything around. This is a major annoyance, leading me to struggle with the windows to go where I want them to go. This is really counter-productive.

**Fix :**

In CompizConfig Configuration Manager, navigate to Wobbly Windows and disable Snap Inverted.
