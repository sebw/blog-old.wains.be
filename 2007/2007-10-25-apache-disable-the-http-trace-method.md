# 'Apache : disable the HTTP TRACE method'

categories:
- Apache


[Marius Ducea](http://www.ducea.com) is sharing an interesting tip about Apache.
Later versions of Apache now have a variable controlling if the trace request method is enabled.

TRACE is a HTTP request method used for debugging which echoes input back to the user.
