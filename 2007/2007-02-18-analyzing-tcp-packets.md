# Analyzing TCP packets

categories:
- RHCE


Reviewing the basics of TCP/IP networking.. I wasn't able to find the command displaying a full detail of datagrams using tcpdump.. And as I tend to always forget how to get that verbose output, I'll post it here for good.

Had to install Wireshark, as I couldn't find how to get it under tcpdump (drop a comment if you know the answer ! :) )

Command :
`$ tshark -V -i eth0`

Output :
