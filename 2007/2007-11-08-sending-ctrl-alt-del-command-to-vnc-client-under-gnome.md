# Sending "Ctrl-Alt-Del" command to VNC client under Gnome

categories:

**The problem :** you want to send the "Ctrl-Alt-Del" command to a remote VNC server to unlock a Windows session, but you are under Gnome and all it does is opening a window with Gnome session options (lock session, restart, etc.)

**How to unlock a Windows session :** Press "Shift-Ctrl-Alt-Del".

May seem obvious, but it tooks me a few minutes to figure out.

Also, vncviewer.exe runs perfectly fine using Wine, probably better than the VNC clients available under Ubuntu.
