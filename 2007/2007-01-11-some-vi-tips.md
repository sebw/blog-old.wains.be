# Some vi tips

categories:

- RHCE


This is my personal vi reminder.
Feel free to share your tips !



Search and replace a string globally in a document :
`:.,$s/search_string/replacement_string/g`

Searching for a string :
Type "/" followed by the string
e.g. : /pattern

Disabling highlighted patterns :
Type ":nohl" to disable highlighting

Comment out several lines at once (I like that one) :
`1. Ctrl + V (visual block)
2. Select the lines you want to be commented out
3. Shift + I (insert mode)
4. Add the "#" character on the first line
5. Press escape`

Copy and paste several lines :
`1. Shift + V (visual line)
2. Select the lines
3. Press "Y" (x lines yanked)
4. Go where you want the block to be pasted and press "p"`

Cut and paste several lines :
`1. Let's say you want to cut 3 lines, put your cursor on the first of the 3 lines
2. Type : 3dd
3. Locate your cursor where you want the block to be pasted
4. Type "p"`

Some key combinations :
`dd : Delete current line
D : Delete from cursor to end of line
d$ : Delete from cursor to end of line
d0 : Delete from cursor to beginning of line
dw : Delete from cursor to end of current word
db : Delete from cursor to beginning of current word
yy : Copy current line (use "p" to paste)`

Here's a great cheatsheet from http://www.worldtimzone.com/res/vi.html
Some advices here may be redundant with the above tips

Cursor movement

    * h - move left
    * j - move down
    * k - move up
    * l - move right
    * w - jump by start of words (punctuation considered words)
    * W - jump by words (spaces separate words)
    * e - jump to end of words (punctuation considered words)
    * E - jump to end of words (no punctuation)
    * b - jump backward by words (punctuation considered words)
    * B - jump backward by words (no punctuation)
    * 0 - (zero) start of line
    * ^ - first non-blank character of line
    * $ - end of line
    * G - Go To command (prefix with number - 5G goes to line 5)
