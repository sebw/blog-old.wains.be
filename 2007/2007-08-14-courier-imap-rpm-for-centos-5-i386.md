# Courier-imap RPM for CentOS 5 (i386 + x86_64)

categories:
- Linux
- Red Hat/CentOS


Someone asked for help about installing courier-imap under CentOS 5.

I made the RPM for him and thought I would share them here.

The whole thing is packaged in a tar.gz

Courier-authlib
Version:	0.59.3 (22-Apr-2007)

Courier-Imap
Version:	4.1.3 (22-Apr-2007)

Download : [http://blog.wains.be/pub/courier-centos5-i386-20070814.tar.gz](http://blog.wains.be/pub/courier-centos5-i386-20070814.tar.gz)

Packages tested and working.


**x86_64**

Charles has been kind enough to build the RPMs for the x86_64 architecture and share them.

Courier-authlib
Version : 0.60.2

Courier-Imap
Version : 4.2.1

Download : [http://blog.wains.be/pub/courier-centos5-x86_64.tgz](http://blog.wains.be/pub/courier-centos5-x86_64.tgz)

I wasn't able to test them, use these at your own risk.
