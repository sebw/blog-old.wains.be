# 'Firefox : always display the address bar'

categories:
- Firefox


It is sometimes tedious when websites try to "hide" the URL in an attempt to prevent you from downloading some content.

**Here's the fix :**

1. Type "about:config" in the address bar
2. Find dom.disable_window_open_feature.location
3. Double click to set the value to true
