# last and lastb

categories:
- Linux


From the man pages :

**Last** searches back through the file /var/log/wtmp (or the file designated by the -f flag) and **displays a list of all users logged in (and out)** since that file was created.  Names of users and ttyâ€™s can be given, in which case  last  will  show  only  those  entries matching the arguments. Names of ttys can be abbreviated, thus last 0 is the same as last tty0.

**Lastb** is the same as last, except that by default it shows a log of the file  /var/log/btmp, which contains all **the bad login attempts**.

Knowing when the machine was rebooted :
`$ last reboot
