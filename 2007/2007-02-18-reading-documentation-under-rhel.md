Several ways to get help quickly.
Need to get used to finding the missing info as fast as possible (I'm already pretty fast usually, but need to improve if possible)..

`man -k named` returns more results than the previous command, search for the string in every man pages available

`# man 8 named`

`# info named`

`Go under /usr/share/doc/package_name`

`command --help or command -h`

Man pages sections :
`man 1 user applications
man 2 system calls
man 3 library calls
man 4 special files
man 5 file format
man 6 games
man 7 misc
man 8 system administration`
