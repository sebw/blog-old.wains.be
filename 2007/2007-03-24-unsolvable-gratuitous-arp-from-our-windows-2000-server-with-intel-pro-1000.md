# 'Unsolvable : Gratuitous ARP from our Windows 2000 server with Intel Pro 1000'

categories:
- Networks
- Windows


With the accuracy of a swiss clock, our windows 2000 server at work sends gratuitous ARP requests every 30 seconds for some unknown reason.

It has always been doing that. I've tried to figure out the issue every now and then, when I had some time to kill.

The question is.. is it software or hardware related ?
The strange thing is the gratuitous arp requests are supposedly from an IP totally unknown in the network.
The NIC is an Intel Pro/1000 CT.

Here's the result of a sniffing session :

Apparently, the Intel NIC might be the cause of the issue.
I installed wireshark on the windows box, but I need to reboot our server in order to get it working.. oh well...
