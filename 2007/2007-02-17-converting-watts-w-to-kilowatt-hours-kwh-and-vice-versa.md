# Converting watts (W) to kilowatt-hours (kWh) and vice-versa

categories:

If you draw 100 W / hour on average

`100W x (8760 hours per year) / 1000 = 876 kWh`

Thus :
`1 kWh = 0.114155 W on average
1 W on average = 8.76 kWh`

The power here costs 0.1429 € per kWh.

`876 kWh * 0.1429 = €125.18`

Leaving something on drawing 100W in average costs €125 per year.
