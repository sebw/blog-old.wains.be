# SaltStack talk at Jeudis du Libre

I talked about configuration management and cloud orchestration with [Salt](https://saltstack.com/) at [Jeudis du libre](http://jeudisdulibre.be) this April 20.

The talk was divided in two parts: presentation and demo.

The slides of both presentation and demo content are available at [https://github.com/sebw/saltstack-talk](https://github.com/sebw/saltstack-talk)

Feel free to contact me if you have any question!
