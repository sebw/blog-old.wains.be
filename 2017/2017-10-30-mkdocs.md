# Migrating the site to Mkdocs

For the past two years, this site has been running with [Wikitten](https://github.com/victorstanciu/Wikitten), a PHP engine that renders Markdown pages to HTML.

The project was not as actively maintained as Mkdocs though, so I decided to switch.

Mkdocs is a static site generator written in Python.

You write pages in Markdown, Mkdocs build the site and static pages are served by the HTTP server of your choice.

Mkdocs offers a built-in dev-server that lets your preview your articles as you write them. This is pretty neat. I'm running Mkdocs in a Docker container on my Macbook so I can preview the result.

When I'm satisfied with the result, I commit the article to GitHub and trigger a pull on my VPS, and a rebuild of the site.
