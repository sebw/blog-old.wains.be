## Who am I

My name is Sebastien Wains.

I'm a cloud and infrastructure senior consultant at Red Hat, the leading provider of enterprise open source solutions.

I'm a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA). [My certification ID is 110-643-822](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/services/verify/?certId=110-643-822).

To learn more about our consulting services, check [https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/consulting).

## Talks

I have talked about [Salt] at [Jeudis du Libre] conference. Check my [Github] for the decks.

I will give a talk about open source orchestration with Ansible at [Ansible Automates EMEA 2020](https://events.redhat.com/profile/form/index.cfm?PKformID=0x165149abcd&sc_cid=7013a000002DeY9AAK).

## A bit more about me

I like building simple, fast, powerful, resilient, secure and automated infrastructures. Preferably based on open tools and protocols.

I care about security and privacy.

I automate things whenever I can! I'm a big fan of [Ansible], **[Node-RED]**, **[Automagic]** on Android, **[Ulauncher]** on Linux, and hackable connected devices. For example, this website is [automated](https://blog.wains.be/2020/2020-02-17-mkdocs-publishing-workflow/).

I'm a heavy keyboard user and as such, [i3wm] is my window manager. I wrote about my desktop environment [here](https://blog.wains.be/2019/2019-12-11-my-linux-desktop-environment/).

When I'm not busy at the computer, I travel, hike, ski, camp out and take photos.

I'm an [INTJ]: INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait of combining imagination and reliability. ~ [Marina Margaret Heiss](http://typelogic.com/intj.html)
