## Who am I

<img src="https://blog.wains.be/images/redhatibm.png" width="250"/>

I'm a cloud and infrastructure senior consultant at Red Hat, the Open Source company.

I'm a Red Hat Certified Architect (RHCA). [My certification ID is 110-643-822](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/services/verify/?certId=110-643-822).

## What I have been up to in the past

In the early age of this blog, I was really into **Linux**, **Postfix**, **OpenVPN** and **Asterisk**.

After changing job I was in charge of several hundred servers. I spent a lot of time automating and orchestrating system administration and management tasks with tools such as [Salt], Salt Cloud, Python, Git/Gitlab, [Mkdocs], [Rundeck], Jenkins, Artifactory, Nexus, [Postman], Red Hat Satellite, iTop, [Graylog], Redmine, etc.

I have talked about [SaltStack] at [Jeudis du Libre] conference. Check my [Github] for the decks.

## At the personal level

I automate things whenever I can! I'm a big fan of **[Automagic]** on Android, **[Alfred]** on Mac, **[Ulauncher]** on Linux, and hackable connected devices.

Publishing on this site is also [automated](https://blog.wains.be/2020-02-17-mkdocs-publishing-workflow/).

## My desktop environment

I use i3. I wrote about my desktop environment [here](https://blog.wains.be/2019/2019-12-11-my-linux-desktop-environment/)

## About me
I like building simple, powerful, resilient, secure and automated infrastructures. Preferably based on open tools and protocols.

I care about security and privacy.

When I'm not busy at the computer, I travel, hike, ski, camp out and take photos.

I'm an [INTJ]: INTJs are known as the "Systems Builders" of the types, perhaps in part because they possess the unusual trait of combining imagination and reliability. ~ [Marina Margaret Heiss](http://typelogic.com/intj.html)
