# Tmux basics

A long long time ago I wrote about `screen`.

While screen has been helping sharing terminals with colleagues or clients for many years, `tmux` is the alternative that can apparently achieve more.

You can refer to [https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/](https://tmuxcheatsheet.com/) for all the useful tips.

My (very) basic usage of tmux is to split the screen when I need to work on anything else than my workstation (on which I run `terminator` that can split terminals).

Also a big difference is that the split happens on the server with `tmux` while it happens on your workstation with `terminator`.

`Ctrl+B %` will split vertically

`Ctrl+B left arrow` will go to the left terminal

`Ctrl+B right arrow` will go... to the right.

`Ctrl+B C` creates a new window

`Ctrl+B n` goes to the next window
