# Ulauncher extension for TPLink HS110 Smart Plugs

I have ordered a TPLink HS110 Smart Plug to test how it compares to my aging Wemo plugs.

They are super straight forward, reliable and they don't hiss like some Wemos can do.

I have created an extension for [Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io) allowing to manage my plug.

It is available at [https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-sebw-ulauncher-tplink-smartplug](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-sebw-ulauncher-tplink-smartplug)
