# Remove Docker orphans

## Orphan volumes

List mountpoints that are not in use:

```
for j in $(for i in $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
do
docker volume inspect $i | grep "Mountpoint" | awk -F':' '{print $2}' | awk -F'"' '{print $2}'
done)
do
du -h --max-depth=1 $j
done
```

Now feel free to remove folder that you considered not needed anymore.

## Orphan images

Removing unused images is possible directly from the Docker command:

```
$ docker image prune -a
WARNING! This will remove all images without at least one container associated to them.
