# Yubikey and shift key on French or Belgian keyboards

For readers with Belgian or French keyboards.

If you configure your Yubikey by default with HOTP, when you touch your Yubikey, the output gives characters instead of digits (like "&é"'(§").

You have two options:

- You can press the `shift` key when you touch your Yubikey 
- You can configure the keymap, using `ykpersonalize`

Option 2 can be achieved with the following command, taken from the documentation:

`ykpersonalize -S06050708090a0b0c0d0e0f111517181986858788898a8b8c8d8e8f9195979899a79e9fa0a1a2a3a4a5a6382b28 -y`
