# Simple HTTP server with Python

Simply run this from the command line and it will server the content of the current directory:

	python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80
	
I recommend setting an alias for that and make sure that the port is always open from the internet. It makes it very easy to share stuff with friends temporarily.
