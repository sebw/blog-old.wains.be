# Outbound Postfix with SASL Authentication against LDAP (Dovecot)

categories:
- Postfix


I recently had to set up an outbound Postfix server with SASL authentication against LDAP.

I'm a huge fan of Dovecot, so I did go with it instead of Cyrus which was a pain to set up a few years back. Not sure about now.

I hadn't done that in a while, and if you look up on this site, you'll see I actually did SASL auth against MySQL, a couple of years ago. Since then, Dovecot reached v2, which involves a lot of changes in the configuration files.

Tested on RHEL 6.3 + Postfix 2.6.6 + Dovecot 2.0.9 + Thunderbird 17 and Outlook 2003/7/10

I assume you install Postfix and Dovecot with yum from the RHEL repositories.

Just add the configuration in the configuration files and you should be fine. Tune to your liking. Some settings may not be the most sensible for your environment, so please do not blindly copy-paste and be done with it.

I owe you a bit of explanation here though.

I'm using the auth_bind method. It means you check if the user is valid by making a bind with the provided credentials. This is nice, you don't need to have access to the password string in LDAP (which I didn't have), and deal with the hashing method used.

Also, something specific to my environment: users would configure their client with their username, which in ldap is under "companyLoginName". Somehow, Dovecot needs to test against the CN, so you have to lookup the companyLoginName string in order to retrieve the cn, you can do so with pass_filter. Then you assign the resulting CN as the actual username (see: pass_attrs).

**/etc/dovecot/ldap.conf.ext**


    
    
    hosts = ldap.example.org
    dn = cn=some,ou=string,ou=from,o=ldap
    dnpass = password
    
    debug_level = 0
    
    auth_bind = yes
    base = ou=somewhere,o=ldap
    scope = subtree
    
    pass_attrs = cn=user
    pass_filter = (&(objectClass=companyAccount)(companyLoginName=%u))
