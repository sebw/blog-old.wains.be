# 'Tool of the day : Dropbox'

categories:
- Tools


I finally gave [Dropbox](http://www.getdropbox.com) a try and it's awesome !
Dropbox makes syncing files across computers a breeze (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows).

I recommend you check their [screencast here](https://www.getdropbox.com/screencast) to get a better idea of what it does.

By default, you get 2 GB with the free account.

If you are interested in testing it, please use the link below for subscribing :

For any new user referred by me, both you and I will get an extra 250 MB on our accounts.
