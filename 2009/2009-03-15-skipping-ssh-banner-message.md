# Skipping SSH banner message

I'm talking about the banner displayed BEFORE connecting, not the MOTD

**By default :**


    
    <code>$ ssh root@server

**Using ssh -q : **

`$ ssh -q root@server
Last login: Sat Mar 14 21:39:00 2009 from mars`

This is particularly interesting when you use rsync with ssh from a cronjob.. if you don't use -q you'll likely get the banner sent to you by email.
