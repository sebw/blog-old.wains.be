# Securing Elasticsearch API with Haproxy

2016-06-18

Elasticsearch API is fully open by default and anyone can create (PUT method) or delete indices (DELETE method).

In a project at work, I was asked to install a fully redondant cluster, and among other things expose the API:  
- over HTTP with no auth for GET method for developers   
- over HTTPS with auth for any methods (PUT, DELETE, etc.) for Elastic admins

The Elastic cluster is orchestrated with Saltstack (I'll publish the states later) and is made of 8 nodes, two of them act as clients (no master nor data role) and are only accessible from two HAproxy nodes (secured with iptables). 

This is the HAproxy configuration, tested on RHEL7.

I intentionally used insecure-password for authentication over HTTPS, so you can basically copy and paste this configuration and test. Please use "password" when you're ready to go in production.
