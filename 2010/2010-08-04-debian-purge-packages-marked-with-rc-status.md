# 'Debian : purge packages marked with rc status'

categories:
- Debian/Ubuntu


Packages with rc status are not completely removed from the system, configuration files are still present.

If you have a bunch of rc packages you need to purge, as root, type :

`dpkg --list |grep "^rc" | cut -d " " -f 3 | xargs sudo dpkg --purge`
