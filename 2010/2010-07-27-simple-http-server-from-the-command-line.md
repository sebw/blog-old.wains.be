# Simple HTTP server from the command line

categories:
- Tools


Tested under Debian Lenny and Mac OS 10.6.3

I've been using this one for a year or so but failed to share it until now..

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

This will start a simple HTTP server listening on port 8000. 
Python needed, of course.

Run that command from the folder you want to share.


By the way if William from Paris is reading this, thanks for the book :-)
