# Essential audio tools

categories:
- Linux
- Tools


I heavily rely on the following tools to manage my music.
I must be using Easytag on a daily basis really. This is definitely the best tool to manage hundreds of MP3's. If you are like me and like to see your music properly sorted in your player, this is definitely the tool you need.

Sound Converter has been able to convert every file I submitted to it. Essential !


**Easytag :**

EasyTAG is an utility for viewing, editing and writing
the ID3 tags of different audio files, using a GTK+ interface.

Currently EasyTAG supports the following:
 - View, edit, write tags of MP3, MP2 files (ID3 tag), FLAC files (FLAC Vorbis
   tag), Ogg Vorbis files (Ogg Vorbis tag), and MusePack, Monkey's Audio files
   (APE tag),
 - Auto tagging: parse filename and directory to complete automatically the
   fields (using masks),
 - Ability to rename files from the tag (using masks) or by loading
   a text file,
 - Process selected files of the selected directory,
 - Ability to browse subdirectories,
 - Recursion for tagging, removing, renaming, saving...,

Now blame me for not using Ogg :-)
