# 'Ubuntu 7.10 : screen doesn''t lock when closing laptop lid'

categories:
- Linux


This used to work in Ubuntu 7.04..

Here's the fix until the feature works again (See bugreport [156226](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-power-manager/+bug/156226) in launchpad)

- Open gconf-editor

- Enable /apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/use_screensaver_settings

You should also enable "blank-screen" in the same section, I noticed the screen doesn't go blank when the lid is closed without it
