**A FULLY WORKING ASTERISK SIP PBX RUNNING WITH ONLY 6 MODULES LOADED ! READ ON...**

This howto is based on Asterisk 1.2 under Debian Etch. Please let me know through the comments if it works for you under other versions (and if it doesn't, please provide the steps to get a working system). Thanks.

**My needs :**

I had to slim Asterisk down to the most minimalistic configuration possible to run on my Linksys NSLU2 (ARM cpu @ 266 MHz, RAM 32 MB).

- SIP calls between my IP phones and softphone
- Incoming/Outgoing calls through a SIP ITSP (ipness.com)
- Echo test to make sure audio is going through in some situation
- I only use the alaw codec, compatible with my IP phones and ITSP, you should avoid transcoding. My DSL connection offers dynamic IP only and gives around 3400 Kbps down/386 Kbps up. I could use the GSM codec, but the ITSP doesn't support it
- No voicemail or other apps

**My setup :**

- The NSLU2 is behind a NAT router
- Home phone on the same subnet as the NSLU2
- Work phone behind NAT
- Softphone used from several places

**Router configuration :**

- Forward port UDP/5060 to UDP/5070 to the NSLU2
- UDP/5060 is used for SIP traffic (signalling)
- UDP/5061 to UDP/5070 is used for RTP traffic (audio)

**Asterisk configuration files :**

Before diving into the configuration..
**IMPORTANT !!!**
If you want to comment something out in the configuration you'll start the line with a semi-colon (";")

The \# sign is used for file inclusions. **# IS NOT USED FOR COMMENTS !!!**

**/etc/asterisk/modules.conf :**

Module loading order can be important. E.g. : res_features.so must be loaded before chan_sip.so


    
    [modules]
    autoload=no             ; only load explicitely declared modules
    
    load => app_echo.so     ; echo application
    load => codec_alaw.so   ; alaw codec for voice
    load => pbx_config.so   ; reading and loading configuration
    load => res_features.so ; chan_sip.so dependency
    load => chan_sip.so     ; SIP protocol
    load => app_dial.so     ; Dial application
    
    [global]



**/etc/asterisk/rtp.conf :**

The audio is going through these UDP ports, they must be forwarded to the server in the router.

In this example, the number of ports used by Asterisk is relatively low (I never have more than one call going through the PBX). Set as much as you need, a channel may need up to 2 ports. Also only even ports are actually used.

	[general]
	rtpstart=5061
	rtpend=5070

**/etc/asterisk/sip.conf :**

Having a dynamic IP, I must use externhost with a fresh rate of 60 seconds for resolving the domain.
If you have a static IP, define it in externip=

Localnet must be defined with your network subnet(s), localnet subnets are never passed in the "Via" parameter (can be seen in sip traces).

realm must be a unique ID

The "register =>" line is necessary in order to receive incoming calls from the ITSP.

**/etc/asterisk/custom_extensions.conf :**

custom_extensions.conf is my customized dialplan

- Home phone and softphone can call local phones (1XXX range) 
- Home phone and softphone can call national (e.g. : 02 123 45 67) and international numbers (00 1 910 123 4567) through the ITSP
- Work phone can only call local phones
- Every phone can call the echo application
- Incoming calls make 1001 ring first, then 1002 and finally 1000 (each with a timeout of 30 seconds)

**/etc/asterisk/custom_sip.conf :**

custom_sip.conf is my customized accounts file.

canreinvite must be set to no for all sip accounts (unless you have several phones on the server subnet, than you can set to yes).
NAT must be set to yes for any device behind NAT routers.
